<p>Now, if there are people that know of my love for writing, it you guys (hence, we are here :) ). Mainly for me, starting a new storyline starts off from anywhere, whether a random thought abput what I would do if I find myself in a certain position, or wanting to escape my current reality. Starting a new storyline is amazing and exciting, to a point where I find myself obsessed with it entirely... for a few days. After that, I would reach a block, not knowing how to move forward.</p>
<p>So, I've decided that maybe if I shared some of my favourite storylines that i couldn't finish, you guys would give the opinion of which storylines should I totally scrap or which of the storylines I should complete that are obviously created for the stars. Down below are a few of my favourite storylines for your perusal. Make sure to let me know which are your new favs ;).</p>
<h2>Ngelosi's love story</h2>
<p>Ngelosi's love story is a Christian take on a beautiful, generic love story. It follows Ngelosi, a 20-something year old researcher, a hopelessly romantic and Christian young woman adulting in Johannesburg. She survives a life-threating car accident and upon waking, asks God to give her and show her, her soulmate. Soon, she meets her guardian angel, sent from above to help her find her soulmate and share eternity together. However, Ngelosi soon learns more about Christianity, her relationship with God and more about she really wants in life while on Earth and how she would loike ti be remembered. it is a wholesome story for young adult christian girls that find themselves in between a rock and a hard place when it comes to living out their religious heart desires and finding their place in the world. Maybe the reason why I find it difficult to complete this one, is because it is close to home.</p>
<h2>Makwande and Mawande</h2>
<p>Okay, I know what you guys are thinking, they are not twins. Instead they are two individuals from not-so-different backgrounds but are at different phases of their lives. One is comtemplating the exsistance of love in their life and the other struggles and fights for the survival of her family name. They meet in the depth in the forest of Ntab'ezikude, where their story begins. initially, this was not a love story, but because of my obsession with love, I had to include it somewhere and somehow. This is where I'll end with this one because what i have in mind is a real plot twist. *Hint: One of them is part of the royal family, and the other, an hieress who inheritence was stolen by a family memeber. Can you guess who it is?</p>
